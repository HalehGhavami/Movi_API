# movie_API

### Objective

To build the **server-side** component of a ‚Äúmovies‚Äù **web application**. The web
application will provide users with access to information about different
movies, directors, and genres. Users will be able to sign up, update their
personal information, and create a list of their favorite movies

### User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to receive information on movies, directors, and genres so that I
  can learn more about movies I‚Äôve watched or am interested in.
- As a user, I want to be able to create a profile so I can save data about my favorite movies

### Technical Requirements

- The API must be a **Node.js** and Express application.
- The API must use **REST** architecture, with URL endpoints corresponding to the data
  operations listed above
- The API must use at least three **middleware modules**, such as the body-parser package for
  reading data from requests and morgan for logging.
- The API must use a ‚Äúpackage.json‚Äù file.
- The database must be built using **MongoDB**.
- The business logic must be modeled with Mongoose.
- The API must provide movie information in JSON format.
- The JavaScript code must be error-free.
- The API must be tested in Postman.
- The API must include user authentication and authorization code.
- The API must include data validation logic.
- The API must meet data security regulations.
- The API source code must be deployed to a publicly accessible platform like GitHub.
- The API must be deployed to Heroku
