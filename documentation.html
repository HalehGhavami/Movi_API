    <p>
      In this project, I will be builing the server-side component of a movie
      database web application. This web application will provide users with
      access to information about different movies, directors, and genres. Users
      can sign up, update their personal info, and create lists of all their
      favorite movies.
    </p>

    <p>
      We will be creating a REST API using the MERN stack. (MongoDB, Express,
      React, and Node.JS)
